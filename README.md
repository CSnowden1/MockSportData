# MockSportData
The app generates 20 mock sporting events and betting data a day. Also, update past game results when game time passes.

The Apps use a ranking system to update ranking and skew results based on past matchup results. Can be used to make bets that are not random, but have data to support the winning team.


This data is needed to use the BetCoin echo system 

Also good for people who need standardized sports betting data
